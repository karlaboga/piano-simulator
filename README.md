# piano-simulator
This project presents a digital piano simulator designed for microcontroller-based music generation. Developed as part of the Microcontrollers and Microprocessors Laboratory at Politécnico Castelo Branco, the system offers an interactive way to explore embedded system programming and digital signal processing.
The piano is built around the PIC16F877A microcontroller, which acts as the core controller for processing input from buttons and switches, generating musical tones, and displaying real-time feedback on an LCD screen. The simulator operates in two distinct modes:
- Manual Mode – Users can play seven musical notes using dedicated buttons, allowing for real-time melody creation.
- Happy Birthday Mode – The system autonomously plays the "Happy Birthday" melody when activated.
This project serves as a practical example of hardware-software integration, showcasing how microcontrollers can be used for signal processing, user interaction, and embedded control systems. The design is implemented and simulated in Proteus, with code development carried out in CCS C Compiler.

How to Use
- Load the project in Proteus for simulation.
- Set SW1 to 0 to activate Manual Mode, then play notes using the buttons.
- Set SW1 to 1 to activate Happy Birthday Mode, which plays the melody automatically.
- Observe feedback on the LCD display.
